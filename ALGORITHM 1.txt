Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n number if so determine
if it is even or odd number?
1-START
2-INPUT two numbers n(number to be divided) and Nth 
3-Check divisibility 
    If n%Nth==0
    Nth is a divisor of n
    GOTO Step 4
    Else
    Nth is not a divisor of n
    GOTO Step 5
4-Determine Even or Odd
    If Nth%2==0
    PRINT Nth is a divisor of n and a even number
    Else 
    PRINT Nth is not a divisor of n and a odd number
5-END
